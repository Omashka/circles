Inside the app, the home screen is a simple, people-first list rather than a feed. Each person is displayed with their name, relationship type, and a subtle indicator showing when the last interaction or check-in was recorded. Selecting a person opens their profile, which functions as a private relationship “cheat sheet.” This profile summarizes key facts such as family details, interests, job changes, birthdays, religious or cultural events, and recent travel, along with any topics the user prefers to avoid. Important dates and recent interactions are highlighted at the top, followed by a chronological timeline of saved moments that lets the user quickly regain context before reaching out or meeting again. The app relies on smart, fully opt-in prompts triggered by user activity rather than any form of message scraping. For example, after a calendar event ends or a phone call concludes, the app may gently ask whether the user wants to save a note about that interaction. These prompts are always dismissible and never automatic, reinforcing that the user remains in full control of what is recorded and when. Beyond individual profiles, the app includes a visual relationship graph that shows how people are connected, such as friends of friends or introductions that led to new relationships. This creates a lightweight web of connections that helps users remember how they know someone without turning relationships into a social network. Optional location sharing can be enabled on a per-contact basis to support better memory of shared experiences, such as where a hangout or meeting took place. Users can also upload photos of friends or shared moments, with each image automatically stamped with date and time, effectively creating a private diary for each relationship that captures memories over time. To make saving information frictionless, the app supports a lightweight widget and paste-based input. Users can quickly paste text, messages, or links to instantly save small reminders or major life events directly to the relevant person’s profile. The app can also pull in user-approved data from calendars and email, automatically linking meetings, events, and shared links to the correct person and categorizing them accordingly. Finally, each profile includes a relationship meter that reflects how recently and consistently the user has checked in or interacted. This meter is informational rather than judgmental, designed to surface awareness and help users maintain meaningful connections without guilt, gamification, or pressure.there should be also a feature to connect contacts for example if they're siblings or friends of friends this should be a drag and drop. then a web diagram such as a genetic thing will show case. showing how each contact is related to one another. then reminders such as someone birthday is coming up and AI suggestion based on what to gift them based on their likes and what they mentioned. if its been more than a month since last connected there should be a reminder to check in with the person. i want you to update the arrows by Line styles Solid = strong (family, partner) Dashed = weaker (acquaintance)

Add a “Why do I know this person?” button.

This turns the web into memory recall, not just visualization. Add fake photos for each contact.
